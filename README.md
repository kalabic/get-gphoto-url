## embed_gphoto_url.sh
Create code for embedding Google Photos image into HTML page.

Script accepts both shared links created by user on Google Photos web page and already created permanent links to image (so, both `photos.app.goo.gl` and `lh3.googleusercontent.com` URLs). It will invoke `get_gphoto_url.sh` script if needed.

Syntax: `embed_gphoto_url.sh <URL> <width> <height> [optional: <CSS class for img>]`
- Width and height for preview image must be provided and will be encoded into URL in a way supported by Google servers.
- CSS class is optional and is added into `img` element as `class` attribute: `<img class="CSS class" ...`
```
Usage: Provide image URL, width, height and redirect output to a file.

./embed_gphoto_url.sh https://photos.app.goo.gl/(your URL...) 1024 1024 > embedded_photo.txt
```
